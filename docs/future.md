# Future possibilities

(to do)

## Crawl (it's broken without this)
- Get the BLIP code into the form it need to be

## Walk (it ought to do this)
- Integrate into Custom Node Manager 
- Bring unprompt in

## Run (it would be nice to do this)
- 'double nodes' for handling positive and negative things together

## Fly (not likely to happen, but dream away)
