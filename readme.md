# CG's custom nodes

A set of custom nodes for ComfyUI. These nodes have been built to support a series of workflows described below, but are designed to be as flexible as possible. They are also a work in progress...

## Installation

cd [ComfyUI root]/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg_custom_nodes.git
